# 📊 Projects

## gatsby-starter-bee

- GitHub repository link: https://github.com/JaeYeopHan/gatsby-starter-bee

It is a blog starter template like [_gatsby-starter-blog_](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog). I made this template with focusing fresh UI, simple, feature as packages. You can see the [demo](https://gatsby-starter-bee.netlify.com/). My [**jbee.io**](https://jbee.io) also created by this template.

### gatsby-remark-images-medium-zoom

- GitHub repository link: https://github.com/JaeYeopHan/gatsby-remark-images-medium-zoom

medium-zoom plugin for gatsby with gatsby-remark-images

## octodirect - chrome extension

- Chrome web store link: http://bit.ly/2wL9Iwv
- GitHub repository link: https://github.com/JaeYeopHan/octodirect
- React, TypeScript, Redux, Redux-saga

It is a chrome extension that allows you to curate the GitHub repository you created or managed, you visited before, you clicked the star, and go directly through the shortcut.

Opening the extension through the shortcut key brings up a list of repositories from multiple sources and shows them. Once you enter the name of the repository, you can easily get links to the repository by filtering it, and you can even go straight to the Enter key.

Versioning and distribution of Chrome extensions is cumbersome. So I am using my own deployment script. This script can be found in 'scripts / deploy.js' in this repository.

If possible, I will talk about the direction to move towards 'the developer we want to work with' based on this content.
